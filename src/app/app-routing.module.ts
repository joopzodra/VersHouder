/**
 * In the appRoutes, all routes are guarded by the AuthGuard. 
 * The AuthGuard is set on every db-manager childroute separately. It could have been set on the 'db-manager' parent route instead of on all the children. But then the AuthGuard isn't called when we navigate from child to child. 
 * We want the AuthGuard to be called on every navigation, because the AuthGuard refreshes the auth-cookie. Since every child receives fresh data from the backend, the backend refreshed the session cookie. We want the auth-cookie and session-cookie to be refreshed simulaniously, so we don't need to handle cases when one is expired while the other is still valid.
