/* Allows a user to pass only if a username has been set. It handles three posibilities:
 * 1. There is no auth-cookie. This cookie is set by the app after login. If it's not set, the user is not logged in, hence no username. The user is refused to pass the guard.
 * 2. There is a username. User can pass the guard.
 * 3. There is an auth-cookie but no username. This happens when a logged in user opens a new browser tab or window. Then a new instance of the app is created, in which no username is set yet. The guard requests the username from the backend via AuthService's getUsername method.
 * Case #3 also catches the error. An 401-error is thrown if we ask for the username but the user is not logged in in the backend. This scenario can happen if the session-cookie is removed manually or by accident. The user should then log in. We then disable the auth-cookie, otherwise in the NotLoggedInGuard this cookie could block navigating to the login page.
